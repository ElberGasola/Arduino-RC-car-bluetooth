# Arduino-RC-car-bluetooth

Bluetooth controlled RC car project. The car consists of 4 DC motors, a battery, L293D motor controller, horn with a small 
speaker and sound preloaded from the arduino, the bluetooth module HC-06 and a small solar panel to help the battery 

It is controlled through an application not mine from Google Play, but anyway the application only sends a command (for example "a"), 
the arduino receives it and so it goes forward It also has an HC SR 04 proximity sensor that causes the car to brake if it has an obstacle in front of it. 

The sensor can be moved by a servo motor
